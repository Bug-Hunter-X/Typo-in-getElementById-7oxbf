# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in HTML/JavaScript: a simple typo in the `getElementById` function.

The bug is present in `bug.html`, where an incorrect version of this function is used.  The corrected version is shown in `bugSolution.html`.

This error can be difficult to spot as the browser console might not always provide a clear error message.  The effect is that the script silently fails and the intended change to the page does not occur.

This example highlights the importance of careful coding and meticulous attention to detail, even in seemingly small aspects of code.
